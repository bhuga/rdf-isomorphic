Changes for 0.3.0:
  * More aggressive marking of nodes as grounded with some checks to
	  explicitly check for non-isomorphism.  The result is a vast performance
		improvement in many real-world cases.
Changes for 0.2.0:
  * Switch to using #node? instead of #anonymous? throughout.
	* Switch to using #count instead of #size, which will be defined on 
	  RDF::Enumerables which do not implement RDF::Countable via ::Enumerator
Changes for 0.1.2:
  * Fixed a bug where subgraphs would incorrectly identify as isomorphic with
	  a supergraph if no blank nodes were involved with either.
Changes for 0.1.1:
  * Improved signature algorithm reduces required rounds in some cases
  * Improved documentation significantly
